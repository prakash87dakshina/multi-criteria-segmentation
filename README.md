# Multi-Criteria ABC Segmentation

This will demonstrate to you how to perform Multi-Criteria ABC Segmentation using both R-Programming and Python.

Multi-criteria ABC segmentation is a supply chain approach that involves categorizing products depending on a variety of factors such as cost, demand, and revenue. The goal of this method is to increase inventory management efficiency by allowing firms to prioritize resources and allocate them to the most profitable or in-demand products. Businesses may build a more sophisticated and accurate segmentation that takes into consideration a variety of characteristics rather than just one by using numerous criteria.

Businesses must first choose the criteria that are most relevant to their business before implementing multi-criteria ABC segmentation. Product profitability, demand variability, and lead time are examples of such factors. Following the identification of these criteria, products are divided into groups based on their performance across each of these criteria. This division enables organizations to properly allocate resources by emphasizing high-value items and lowering investment in low-value ones.

One of the primary advantages of multi-criteria ABC segmentation is that it allows organizations to make better inventory management decisions. Businesses may limit the risk of stockouts and lost sales by prioritizing high-value products, while simultaneously lowering the expense of carrying inventory. Furthermore, this segmentation can assist organizations in identifying cost-cutting options by highlighting items that are less profitable or have lesser demand. Overall, multi-criteria ABC segmentation is an effective strategy for increasing supply chain efficiency and profit.

In total, there will be two sets of scripts which make use of ABC Analysis to perform segmentation:

- Product Segmentation (via R-Programming)
- Supplier Segmentation (via Python)

## Product Segmentation

The ABC analysis is based on the Pareto principle, which argues that the bulk of revenue is generated by a small fraction of the items (or customers) (or profit). Usually, we we will classify these SKUs into either one of the three categories:

![ABC Analysis](https://github.com/dwoo-work/multi-criteria-abc-segmentation/blob/8f75103b8bccfac1bbf055022b96b2837e466446/img/ABC_Analysis.png)

Once the SKUs are classified, the strategies for inventory management will be different across them:

- Category A: High-value products that represent a significant proportion of the revenue and profit.
- Category B: Products with moderate value.
- Category C: Low-value products that generate minimal revenue or profit.

This will be all it takes, if you are performing a normal ABC Analysis using one criteria (i.e. revenue). However, if you are looking to use two or more criterias (i.e. both quantity and revenue), then you would have to perform a Multi-Criteria ABC Analysis.

| Quantity | Revenue | Category                   |
| ---------| ------- | -------------------------- |
| A        | A       | Margin & Volume Drivers    |
| A        | B       | Volume Drivers             |
| A        | C       | Volume Drivers             |
| B        | A       | Margin Driver              |
| B        | B       | Regular                    |
| B        | C       | Regular                    |
| C        | A       | Margin Driver              |
| C        | B       | Regular                    |
| C        | C       | Slow Moving                |

Businesses can then develop particular strategies for controlling each category of products after they have been separated. High-value products in the A category, for example, may necessitate more frequent monitoring and replenishment, but low-value products in the C category may benefit from a vendor-managed inventory program. Businesses may enhance their inventory management operations and boost profitability by customizing their tactics to the individual features of each group.

In brief, multi-criteria ABC analysis enables firms to develop a more tailored and specialized set of plans by taking into consideration a variety of aspects that influence inventory performance. By adapting their tactics to the individual demands of each group, firms may optimize their inventory management procedures and drive profitability.

## Supplier Segmentation

The Kraljic Matrix is a supply chain management tool that helps firms examine their purchasing portfolio and build supplier sourcing strategy. Peter Kraljic created the matrix in 1983, and it has two dimensions: supply risk and profit effect. The potential of supply interruption is referred to as supply risk, whereas profit impact is the financial impact of the item on the organization. Businesses can establish customized sourcing strategies for each item by putting products on the matrix depending on these two parameters.

The Kraljic Matrix is noteworthy because it gives a structured method to purchasing portfolio analysis and the formulation of sourcing strategies. Businesses can identify which products require more attention and resources and which can be managed more efficiently by categorizing them based on their supply risk and profit impact. This allows firms to create a tailored sourcing strategy for each item, which can assist to decrease costs, improve quality, and reduce supply chain risk.

On top of that, it also provides a platform for firms to consider their supply chain more strategically. Businesses can build more successful sourcing strategies that correspond with their overall company objectives by focusing on the goods that are most vital to the organization. Businesses, for example, may elect to emphasize on long-term relationships with suppliers for high-risk, high-value things, while employing more transactional ties for low-risk, low-value items. This strategic strategy can assist businesses in increasing supply chain efficiency and profitability.

Two metrics are used to evaluate each supplier - the complexity of their products (risk) and their impact on our business (cost). In order to assess the level of risk, a Risk Rank will be utilized, ranging from 0 (least risky) to 2 (most risky):

| risk factors       | + 0.0 (N)            | + 0.5 (Y)               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------| ----------------------- |
| availability       | regular              | seldom                  |
| suppliers          | many                 | few                     |
| product_complexity | standard             | complex                 |
| price_stability    | stable               | unstable                |

The cost can be determined using the formula provided below:

Cost = (Cost per unit) x (Total units planned for purchase)

![Kraljic's Matrix Diagram](https://github.com/dwoo-work/MultiCriteriaABC.Analysis/blob/0a89153bb25bf3f79aac81b93a0df28b6b9eb45a/img/Kraljic's_Matrix_Diagram.png)

Kraljic's Matrix has four quadrants: Strategic Items, Bottleneck Items, Leverage Items, and Non-Critical Items. The following are the tactics used in each quadrant:

Strategic Items: Things that are both vital to the business and have a high level of supply risk are classified as strategic items. Building long-term relationships with suppliers and working cooperatively to mitigate supply chain risk is the method for controlling these issues. This could include collaborating on joint innovation projects, sharing risk and benefit, and engaging in supplier development programs. The goal is to establish a long-term mutually beneficial relationship that provides a steady supply of necessary commodities.

Bottleneck Items: Bottleneck items are those that are vital to the business yet have a minimal supply risk. The management strategy for these items is to optimize the supply chain in order to reduce lead times and assure timely delivery of the commodities. Working with numerous suppliers, boosting safety stock levels, and building contingency plans to manage supply disruptions may be required. The goal is to maintain a consistent supply of vital commodities while reducing supply chain risk.

Leverage Items: Things with a high level of supply risk but are not vital to the business are considered leverage goods. To manage these products, the company's purchasing power is used to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers. Consolidating purchases, creating alternative suppliers, and using competitive bidding to drive down prices are all possibilities. The goal is to lower the cost of non-essential commodities while minimizing the risk of supply disruption.

Non-Critical Items: Products that are neither vital to the business nor have a significant level of supply risk are classified as non-critical. To reduce procurement costs, the strategy for handling these things is to use transactional relationships with suppliers. Using online marketplaces, standardizing requirements, and minimizing the number of vendors may all be part of this. The goal is to reduce the cost of non-critical commodities while eliminating additional supply chain complexity.
